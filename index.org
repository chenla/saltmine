Lay it out:

- Everything is both a node and a holon

- Nodes are the atomic unit in the system

- Every node can be thought of as a git repo, and like IPFS,
  are funcionally equivilent to and interchangable with a
  git repo.

- Every holon is a node called a topicspace (tspace) which
  is a map of the nodes that comprises it using a special
  map filetype that includes ID's and defines the
  relationships between nodes.  There is no one cannonical
  tspace, there may be multiple maps that are completely
  separate, overlap or nest within other tspaces.  The
  namespaces that map over nodes are not required to be
  ecorded in the nodes themelves.

- Nodes have their own namespace, and are broken into
  records which each have a unique label and global ID
  within that namespace.
